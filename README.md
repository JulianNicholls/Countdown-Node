# Countdown Magician 4

This is an update to my Countdown solver, rebooted with Create-React-App.

The new part is the solver for the numbers round.

This version runs [here](https://reallybigshoe.co.uk/countdown/index.html).

### Git client

I have used Git at the command-line for more than 10 years. Over that time, I have
tried many different graphical shells for Git, without finding one that was
easier and nicer to use than the command-line (in my view).

I have now found that [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com) is an excellent Git
shell that runs on PC, Mac, and Unix. I would encourage everyone to use it.
